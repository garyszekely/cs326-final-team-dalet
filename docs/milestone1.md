## Part 1: Wireframes
  ### Landing Page
  ![Landing Page Wireframes Image](LandingPageWireframes.png "Landing Page Wireframes")

  The wireframe for the Landing Page. The idea was to have a minimalistic looking view on startup, such as Facebook, so the user does not get distracted by too many animations, carousels, and dropdowns. Just a simple login and signup.

  #### Student Signup
