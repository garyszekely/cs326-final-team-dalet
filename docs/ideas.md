### Innovative Idea

For our project we will be developing a web application that connects clubs on campus to individuals in a much more cohesive way. Clubs will be able to sign up and post about themselves and the various things they have to offer while students can browse through and select which clubs they would like to be a part of. This is related to other web applications as it functions like a Facebook Marketplace for clubs. People are able to freely browse from the comfort of their homes, the clubs on campus without feeling rushed or pressured to make a decision.

### Important Components

To build the above web application we would need to outine two distinct user types: club and student. The "club" user type would be able to create a page for themselves, write a description, add photos, accept members, and manage the overall outlook of their club to the students on campus. The "student" user type on the otherhand would be able to browse these club pages, view these written descriptions, flip through the club photos, submit a request to join a club and filter clubs by category such as "STEM", "Finance", "Athletic" etc. "Students" will have access to a schedule that tracks their club's meetings and events. Finally, "students" will be able to add a like to clubs and be recommended new clubs based on their likes.
